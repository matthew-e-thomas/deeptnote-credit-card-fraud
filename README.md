# deeptnote-credit-card-fraud
playing with scikit-learn and Deepnote notebooks on a credit card fraud dataset

Deepnote is a new (as of this writing) notebook meant to compete with Jupyter. It works all on the cloud and allows for easy 
collaboration. Here I'm just testing it out and playing with it by running some models with Scikit-Learn on a dataset 
from kaggle.com meant to detect credit card fraud.
